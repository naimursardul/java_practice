// A line of code is called a statement. A statement performs a specific task. You can add as many statements (or lines of code) as you need. If any code consists of 2 statements, it will output two messages in different lines. When you give the computer many statements, the instructions will be executed line by line, from top to bottom. Java is a case-sensitive language.
