// A variable can change its value during the program multiple times.
// - A variable has a name and a type of the value it holds.
// - To declare a variable use the type followed by the name of the variable.
// - You can assign a value to the declared variable using the = operator.
// - A variable can change its value during the program, by being assigned to a new value.
